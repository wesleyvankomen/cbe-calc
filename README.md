# CBE GPA Calculator

Greetings, human! If you are reading this, you are probably a senior student at Western Washington University, and have picked up this project as your own senior project. This document will try to get you up to speed on the codebase. 

## What This Is

This is a Chrome extension. The expected users are students and advisors at Western Washington University's College of Business and Economics. The purpose of the extension is to show users what valid business classes a student has taken and what their college-specific GPA is. It achieves this by scraping data from the unofficial transcript and parsing it.

## How it's Written

It's written in JavaScript, with HTML and CSS for rendering. It uses the Angular framework and the X-Editable library.

### How The Code Is Structured

A lot of the business logic is in angular.js, including all the angular-related code. The file backend.js contains all the functions to parse the transcript text, create the lists of applicable classes, and calculate the GPA.
